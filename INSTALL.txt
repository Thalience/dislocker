INTRODUCTION
`------------

This file describes how to install dislocker onto your machine.



REQUIREMENTS
`------------

You need:
 - Headers for FUSE, if you want to use FUSE;
 - Headers for PolarSSL;
 - A partition encrypted with BitLocker, from Windows Vista or 7.

For Debian:
  aptitude install libfuse-dev libpolarssl-dev
For Fedora:
  yum install fuse-devel polarssl-devel
For OSX: Follow the instructions n the next section.

Of course, you need a compiler (tested against gcc 4.6 and darwin 10-4.2.1).

Note that the code expects FUSE 2.6, when using the decryption with FUSE.



INSTALLING
`----------

First thing to do is to cd into the src/ directory. Then, each OS type has its
own section below, beware to follow yours:

. If you are on MacOSX, just install Homebrew (http://brew.sh/) and run the
following command:
$ brew install brew_install_dislocker.rb
This will install dislocker in FUSE mode.

. If you're on FreeBSD, run the following commands for installing the required
libraries:
$ pkg install polarssl
$ pkg install gmake
$ pkg install fusefs-libs
Then follow the instructions below (next point):

. If you aren't on MacOSX...
As you may know, the driver can be used in two ways: using FUSE or not. By
default, typing `make` will generate a FUSE capable binary. However, running
`make file` won't include FUSE capabilities. In this latter mode, dislocker
will decrypt your BitLocker volume into a file, so make sure you have enough
space left on your partition. The file will be a NTFS partition then.
Thus, make your choice of the use you'll have.

Type: `make` or `make file` according to your needs, then `sudo make install`
(or just the last one if you're lazy, but I don't recommend that). Note that the
`-Werror' flag on the `WFLAGS' line in the Makefile may break the compilation,
so you can remove it, but it is as your own risks.

The binary will be installed into `/usr/bin/' by default, edit the INSTALL_PATH
variable (into the Makefile) to change that before the `make install` command.

Once installed, see dislocker(1) for details on how to use it.



UNINSTALLING
`------------

I'm sure you don't want to do that. But if you're really forced by someone, just
type `make uninstall`.



PORTABILITY
`-----------

Globally, this was successfuly tested on Linux x86/x86_64. It won't work on
Windows and may not work on *BSD (never tested).

For MacOSX, it has been tested against OSXFUSE 2.3.8 and 2.3.9.

Whether it works or not, feel free to send comments and feedbacks to
<dislocker __AT__ hsc __DOT__ fr>.

Thanks goes to Rogier Wolff for testing.



NOTE
`----

In many directories included into the sources, there's a Makefile with rules to
build a standalone binary. To build these standalone binaries, cd to the
directory and type `make`, thus creating a binary which you can use to do some
process separately.

Binary capable directories:
- accesses/bek/: read a .bek file and display information about it;
- accesses/rp/: calculate the intermediate key for a given recovery password;
- encryption/: test encryption/decryption on a test case;
- metadata/: read a BitLocker volume and display information about its metadata;
- outputs/fuse/: FUSE's hello world example.
